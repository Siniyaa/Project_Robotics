# Occlusion-aware segmentation of deformable slender objects
## Abstract

We propose an algorithm for detecting the topology of a deformable slender object (DSO) in terms of its self intersections. The topology refers to the order of self intersections that the DSO has with itself. Based on the topology of the DSO, we can define the knot structure that it forms. The proposed algorithm is important in robotic manipulaton of DSO such as cables and ropes. Such deformable objects are oniquitous in the natural environment, however, robotic manipulation still primarly focuses on the rigid object assumption. The main challenge associated with the manipulation of deformable objects come from the perception of the object. The perception challenges arise from two key factor: (1) DSO lack a fied shape, making their tracking and modelling complex, and (2) self occlusions occur in certain configurations of the DLO, where parts of the DLO obscure other sections. Traditional object detection methods often rely on distinct geometric features that are effective for rigid objects but fail when applied to deformable ones. To address these challenges, we propose a DLO segmentation scheme that can segment DLOs from a scene while also accounting for the order of self-occlusion. Our approach involves a two-stage process: the first stage focuses on segmentation, while the second stage resolves intersection ambiguities. For segmentation, we propose to utilize a pre-trained segmentation backbone and fine-tune it on a DLO-specific dataset to improve accuracy. Once the intersection positions are identified, we hypothesize that the order of intersection can be predicted by examining the change in RGB values along the DLOs. Specifically, for the DLO on top, the RGB change along its length will be minimal, whereas for the DLO beneath, a sharp change in RGB values will be observed. We will validate this self-occlusion-aware segmentation method using real-world images of DLOs, evaluating both the accuracy of pixel segmentation and the correct prediction of intersection order. The perception and segmentation of deformable linear objects will allow for more natural interactions between robots and DLO. This will have an impact in construction, cable laying, medical applications etc. where robots can be used for DLO manipulation. In particular, the order of self-occlusion is important for knot-tying tasks that are common in medical suturing.

The figures show the DSO in almost the same geometrical configuration. However, since the intersection order is different, the topology is different.
