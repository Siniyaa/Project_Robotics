# Automated Detection of Coronary Artery Disease 
## Abstract
The automatic detection of disease risk through genetic data is a cornerstone of precision medicine. Gene mutations can influence how individuals metabolize medications, leading to variable disease responses. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), a prevalent heart condition, is significantly influenced by genetic inheritance, cholesterol levels, and other factors. Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) help identify genetic variants associated with CAD risk. This project focuses on applying machine learning techniques to automatically detect CAD by analyzing genotype and phenotype data. The results demonstrate that machine learning can predict the likelihood of CAD development and identify critical genetic features contributing to the disease, enabling more accurate and personalized risk assessments.

The figures show the DSO in almost the same geometrical configuration. However, since the intersection order is different, the topology is different.
