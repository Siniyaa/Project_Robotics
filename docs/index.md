# Automated Detection of Coronary Artery Disease 
## Abstract
The automatic detection of disease risk through genetic data is a cornerstone of precision medicine. Gene mutations can influence how individuals metabolize medications, leading to variable disease responses. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), a prevalent heart condition, is significantly influenced by genetic inheritance, cholesterol levels, and other factors. Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) help identify genetic variants associated with CAD risk. This project focuses on applying machine learning techniques to automatically detect CAD by analyzing genotype and phenotype data. The results demonstrate that machine learning can predict the likelihood of CAD development and identify critical genetic features contributing to the disease, enabling more accurate and personalized risk assessments.

## Introduction


# Introduction

Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) manifests as the gradual deposition of atherosclerotic plaques within the coronary vasculature, consequently compromising the crucial oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue [Chen2021]. CAD stands as a significant contributor to mortality worldwide [US9125574B2]. The World Health Organization (WHO) has projected that the mortality rate attributed to heart diseases will increase to approximately 23 million cases by 2030 [Ayatollahi2019].

The extensive and distinct ramifications of CAD underscore the critical need for early diagnosis [Wang2003]. There are two established diagnostic methodologies that warrant attention: the invasive modality of angiography and the non-invasive technique of electrocardiography. The former is intrinsically linked to potential risks, while the latter can sometimes present challenges in achieving optimal levels of precision and reliability [Alizadehsani2018].

Detecting CAD at an early stage poses a formidable challenge. Numerous computational-based methodologies have emerged in the field of disease management. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has increasingly integrated itself into disease detection and healthcare management [Narula2016]. Machine learning (ML) algorithms excel at efficiently processing and analyzing large datasets, particularly when dealing with complex data such as medical images, patient records, and genetic profiles. This study explores the integration of ML and Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) to predict CAD and identify genetic factors contributing to the disease's onset.

This research leverages the UK Biobank, a substantial biological and medical repository, to analyze clinical and genetic data and predict CAD risk. The ultimate goal is to develop personalized CAD treatment strategies that align with each individualâ€™s unique genetic and medical profile, marking a transformative shift in healthcare.
