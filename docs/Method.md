# Methodology
In our project, we propose to use a vision based system to develop perception algorithms for DSO. We introduce the different hardware and software aspects of the proposed perception algorithm.
## Sensor
There are many different types of cameras available in the market that can be used for our project. We mainly focus on RGB and RGB-D cameras.
### RGB camera
RGB cameras are commonly used in robotics projects to obtain information about the environment. The basic principle of an RGB camera is that
