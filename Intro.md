# Introduction
Defomable objects are all around us and humans are able to naturally interact with them to accomplish various tasks that are not possible with rigid objects. There are several challenges that limit the use of robots for the manipulation of deformable objects. Unlike rigid objects, deformable objects exhibit significant flexibility and elasticity that make it difficult to model them effectively. Especially in the case of active manipulation, the configuration of the object is dynamic and is subject to change througout the manipulation. Without accurate perception algorithms for deformable objects, robots would struggle to find the current state of the deformable object and therefore cause large errors in manipulation. Moreover, we need perception methods that do not impose additional forces and moments on the deformable objects. In this project, we propose to use a vision based method to percieve a DSO that will be manipulated by a robot.
